[![Compile SCSS](https://github.com/nexus-themes/Virtual-Boy-v2/actions/workflows/compile.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GH0STP4WZ/Virtual-Boy-v2/actions/workflows/compile.yml)

Virtual Boy v2 is a from-the-ground-up remake of the original Virtual Boy BD-Theme by [GH0STP4WZ](https://gh0stp4wz.is-a.dev).

It aims to be a vastly improved, more maintainable theme over the Original.

Key improvements over the original include:
- Easier Color customization
- Easier Font Tweaking
- More Readable Source Tree

Features of Virtual Boy v2 include:
- A dark, boldly colored and squared interface inspired by a lost game console of the same name.
- A responsive Layout, which puts the emphasis on the Chat view, and tucks away space-intrusive elements on smaller screens. (To Be Implemented)
- The ability to debloat Discord's interface by allowing users to select unneeded elements. Ex: No Nitro Upsell, Clan Tag removal, Quest-hiding...just to name a few. (To Be Implemented)

## Roadmap
- [x] Basic chatview implementation
- [ ] Further integration with other pages
- [ ] Re-Implement Compact Window mode
- [ ] Public Testing
- [ ] Basic BD Plugin Support
- [ ] Further Bugfixing
- [ ] Full Public Release
